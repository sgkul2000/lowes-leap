# Practical difference between HashMap and HashTable in Java

 - HashMap is non-syncronized and is not thread safe while HashTable is thread safe and is synchronized.
 - HashMap allows one null key and values can be null whereas HashTable doesn't allow null key or value.
 - HashMap is faster than HashTable.
